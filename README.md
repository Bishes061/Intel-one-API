# Problem Statement:
- Agriculture sector in India holds the record for the second-largest agricultural land in the world generating employment for about half of the country's population. However, its contribution accounts for only 20% to the country’s GDP. There is a need to increase the output of the sector to meet the ever-increasing demand.
- Indian farmers aren’t able to choose the optimal crop based on their soil requirements depending upon factors like N, P, K, temperature, humidity, rainfall, pH.
- About 30-35% of the annual crop yield in India gets wasted because of plant diseases and pest attacks.

# Solution:
- Many new technologies, such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning, are being implemented into agriculture so that it is easier for farmers to grow and maximize their yield.
- We developed Agrify- a one-stop solution for farmers introducing them to the concept of precise farming.
- Precision agriculture (PA) is the science of improving crop yields and assisting management decisions using high technology sensor and analysis tools.
- We built a Crop recommender system, which takes into account the essential land requirements for farming, like nutrient concentration, soil pH, etc, and external factors as temperature, humidity, etc, to recommend a crop to a farmer that would give optimal output in the given conditions.
- Crop loss due to plant diseases can be controlled to a great extent if curated at an early stage. We, therefore, developed a plant disease detection system to aid farmers identify diseases to prevent crop loss. We propose to use the Intel® oneAPI AI Analytics toolkit for optimizing our application with the help of Intel® optimized python packages, including but not limited to Intel® optimized Scikit-Learn and Modin libraries for data-preprocessing and AI TensorFlow Kit for Image Preprocessing for Plant Disease detection.

# Future Scope:
- An optimal utilization of our proposed Agrify application would help boost crop production. It would reduce food shortages, generate more employment, and industrialize agriculture as the pillar of the Indian economy.
